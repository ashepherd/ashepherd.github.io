    I'm a terrible writer. I don't practice enough, and proposal writing freaks me out. I survive by making a playlist each time that helps me focus.

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stayin' Alive</strong>, <em>Scary Pockets, Lizzy McAlpine</em> - Infinite Game Theory suggests the #1 objective of all business enterprises should be to continue to play the game. The proposal process is all about sticking around one more day.</li>
      <li><strong>Shake It Up</strong>, <em>The Breathing Effect</em> - "What's it gonna be today? I guess I'll do the same thing....as yesterday."</li>
      <li><strong>Bad Habit</strong>, <em>Steve Lacy</em> - Is what we are writing going to land with the reviewers? Steve Lacy catpures it...."I wish I knew you wanted me!"</li>
      <li><strong>Bad Idea</strong>, <em>Cordae</em> - I'm gonna write to terrible stuff. "Looking at the bigger picture, portrait, and I smile wide."</li>
      <li><strong>People Under the Stairs</strong>, <em>Mac Miller</em> - This song was released during an epic promotion by Mac Miller. The story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Life,_Thank_You#Promotion">how he built an audience</a> is inspiring "...I'm locked in the lab, workin'"</li>
